        <p>Hello, my name is Ayang Jhetem, people have difficulties 
            with it's pronunciation so everyone just calls me Jerti. I'm from 
            Nigeria, I live in Calabar. I recently graduated from dental school 
            and I'm doing my compulsory one year internship in Benin City. 
            I love video games, art and I'm basically addicted to music. 
            I'm currently learning how to play the keyboard it's pretty difficult 
            but I will persevere like always. I love knowledge and I strongly 
            believe the day I stop learning is the day I begin to die on the 
            inside</p>

The country boasts a mix of traditional and modern influences, from vibrant music and art scenes to a growing economy. Home to bustling cities like Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria is a hub of commerce and culture. However, it faces challenges such as economic inequality and regional tensions. Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains a resilient nation with a strong sense of identity and potential for growth.</p>
