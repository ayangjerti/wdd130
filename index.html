        <p>Greetings! My name is Ayang Jhetem, affectionately known as Jerti due to the delightful challenge my full name presents in pronunciation. Originating from the vibrant land of Nigeria, I currently call the picturesque city of Calabar my home. As a recent graduate from dental school, I find myself immersed in the whirlwind of a compulsory one-year internship, navigating the bustling streets of Benin City.

            Beyond the realm of dentistry, my passions serve as windows into my multifaceted personality. I harbor a profound love for video games, finding solace and excitement in virtual worlds. Art holds a special place in my heart, serving as a canvas for expression and a source of inspiration. However, it is my addiction to music that truly defines me. The rhythmic beats and soul-stirring melodies are my constant companions, shaping my experiences and emotions.
            
            In the pursuit of expanding my horizons, I have recently embarked on a musical journey by learning to play the keyboard. Admittedly, it proves to be a challenging endeavor, yet my determination and perseverance, qualities that have served me well in the past, remain unwavering. I firmly believe that the difficulty of the present moment is but a stepping stone to the joy of mastery that awaits.
            
            Fueling my endeavors is an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I subscribe to the belief that the day one ceases to learn is the day the spark within begins to flicker. Hence, I approach each day as an opportunity to glean insights, acquire new skills, and delve into the vast ocean of wisdom that surrounds us.
            
            In essence, my journey is one marked by diverse interests, unwavering determination, and a profound love for the ever-evolving tapestry of knowledge and experience.</p>

        <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the most populous country on the continent and the seventh-most populous in the world. With a rich tapestry of cultures, languages, and ethnicities, Nigeria is known for its diversity. The country boasts a mix of traditional and modern influences, from vibrant music and art scenes to a growing economy. Home to bustling cities like Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria is a hub of commerce and culture. However, it faces challenges such as economic inequality and regional tensions. Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains a resilient nation with a strong sense of identity and potential for growth.</p>
